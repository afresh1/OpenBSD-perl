libpthread isn't needed because of the TIB work.  libutil, well, I don't 
think it's been needed for a long time, if ever; just a generic configure 
script in action.

I've been running my laptop with this for a couple days.

Amusingly, this is mostly polish: the new libpthread doesn't install its 
callbacks until a process does something that requires the threading bits 
to initialize, so this just saves a bit of memory and a bit of ld.so's 
time.
