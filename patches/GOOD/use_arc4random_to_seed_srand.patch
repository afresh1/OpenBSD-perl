Subject: perl: stop using /dev/arandom
User-Agent: Alpine 2.11 (BSO 23 2013-08-11)


{Perl_,}seed() is a maybe-public API in libperl (c.f. perlapi(1)) which
currently reads a U32 from /dev/arandom.  That's not as good as just
calling arc4random(), as the device doesn't work in chroots, etc.  While
it's configurable for various other sources, Perl_seed() doesn't currently
have a "just call this other function, dammit" define, so here's the blunt
hammer diff to pound arc4random() into it.

(Perl_seed() is only used in perl itself as the seed generator if you call
perl-level srand() without an argument, and similarly the perl-level
rand() without previously seeding it.)

Yay/nay?
