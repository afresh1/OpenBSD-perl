It looks like pod2man(1) is called all over the place by many
components of various build systems, so trying to pass --utf8
everywhere seems tedious, maybe hopeless to me.  Instead, i propose
to make --utf8 the default on OpenBSD and provide --no-utf8 for
people who know what they are doing and do not want it.

What do you think about the patch below?

Commit it?  Post it to a few more people for review?  Or to tech@?
Or forget it and try to track down all calls to pod2man(1) in all
the build systems instead?

Yours,
  Ingo
