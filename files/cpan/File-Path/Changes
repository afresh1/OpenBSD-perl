2.12_002 2017-03-12
    - GH#41 RT 117019 Fixed File::Path::remove_tree option hash is auto
                      populated and cannot be reused

    - RT 94209  document that the thread safety issue will not change and
      communicate alternative.
    - RT 85878  be more generous with error check regex given we could be
      dealing with a pre-1.25 Carp.
    - GH #33    Be more precise in documentation example for make_path
      error checking.
    - GH #34 Skip Windows 2000 and earlier unit tests (test change).

      error handling mechanism for root nodes.
    - RT 105935 Change ERROR HANDLING doc section to remove the EXPERIMENTAL
      note; the error handling mechanism has been in place for several versions.


2.11_004 2015-10-01
    - RT 105935 Revert change made in 2.10_001 to carp on failure to find root
      directory when performing an rmtree.

2.11_003 2015-08-03
    - Fix root tests to properly call prereq() -- failed primarily on Windows
      since getpwent/getgrent not implemented on Windows.

2.11_002 2015-07-25
    - Fix windows refactored tests - missing import and since it's out of
      Path.t the path creation creates 2 directories (t/Path_win32.t)
    - Fix root only tests.  getpwent/getgrent was called twice, causing
      skip_all to trigger and giving impression all tests pass.

    - RT 105527 FIX: Move eg/ and author tests from t/Path.t to xt/
    - RT 105935 FIX: Clarify error behavior for rmtree errors on root directory

      rmtree is to 'rm -r'.
    - RT 105977 FIX: Fix INSTALLDIRS for Perl 5.6
    - RT 105986 FIX: Refactor unit tests to better care for test counts
    - RT 106039 FIX: Wrong version in Pod

    - RT 106045 FIX: _run_for_warning does not consume multiple messages
    - RT 106047 FIX: _run_for_verbose cause fail test on 5.6.2
    - Removed optional File::Output usage and run those tests for everyone.

2.11     2015-07-17
    - Change argument check error from croak to carp since there are some
      dependent modules using non-standard options.  The error check will
      move back to croak when dependent modules have the opportunity to
      correct the argument.

2.10_005 2015-07-17
    - Better argument checking and reporting of failure for unrecognized
      options.
    - RT 71562 Document automount race condition limitation and workaround

      limitation may be removed in a future release.

2.10_004 2015-07-10
    - Remove use of English.pm since it breaks many older Perls

2.07_03 2009-06-21 13:11:30 UTC
    - Merged 2.07_02 patches from blead
    - Remove stat checks on Windows platform (inhibits

      immune to this particular attack). CPAN #34701

2.07 2008-11-09 13:05:50 UTC
    - Another VMS test tweak from Craig and additional
      improvements from Gisle.

      from Gisle Aas.

2.06_06 2008-10-05 21:55:34 UTC
    - Documentation improvements, no code changes.  In this version
      rm_tree() was renamed to remove_tree().

2.06_05 2008-10-02 20:30:17 UTC
    - Introduce make_path() and rm_tree() API extension.
    - Remove problematic test revealed by Matt Kraal on QNX
      (see http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/140187)

2.06_04 2008-05-13 14:28:10 UTC
    - Can't use \S+ if a directory name contains a space (which
      it will may do on Windows (the continuing saga of CPAN #35708)).

2.06_03 2008-05-12 20:17:33 UTC
    - ancestor removal test getting slashed up on Windows
      (see CPAN #35708).

2.06_02 2008-05-12 09:53:39 UTC
    - Problem on Windows where c:\path\to\dir was not considered
      to be underneath C:/Path/To (issues of directory separators
      and case sensitivity). As reported in smoke report
      http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/05/msg1435813.html

2.06_01 2008-05-10 20:54:35 UTC
    - Close directory handle in t/Path.t with closedir (close is
      close but incorrect). Problem identified with Strawberry

2.06 2008-05-08 09:27:24 UTC
    - skip counts for ancestor rmpath() tests were wrong
    - fix old/new interface heuristics as per Gisle Aas
      http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/05/msg136625.html

2.05 2008-05-07 08:20:20 UTC
    - better diagnosics and less panicking when
      removing an ancestor path. Reported by Alan Ferrency
      and patch suggested by Michael Schilli (#31721).
    - fix typo spotted by Brendan O'Dea (#35623).

2.04 2007-11-22 13:43:34 UTC
    - integrate blead change #32276 (rmtree a file on VMS)
      (see http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.changes/2007/11/msg20108.html)
    - add a test to show that we can rmtree() a file
    - specify core prereqs in Makefile.PL (as per cpants)

2.03 2007-11-04 18:11:51 UTC
    - On 5.8.x, the installation would be shadowed by the core
      files, and thus not be visible. Makefile.PL tweaked
      appropriately to ensure that the installation overwrites
      the core files. Users on 5.6 and below need not upgrade,
      users on 5.8 should. Bug spotted by imacat (#30459).
    - Minor changes to the way POD tests are initialised.

2.02 2007-10-24 10:05:30 UTC
    - documentation correction fix only: corrected name of module
      File::Find::Rule. Users need not upgrade.

2.01 2007-09-29 10:16:34 UTC
    - the documentation referred to 'skip_others', but the attribute
      is named 'safe'.
    - correctly test VMS behaviour when safe attribute is set.

2.00_11 2007-09-08 12:51:30 UTC
    - depth attribute (for keep_root functiionality) was not
      correctly initialised in both old and new APIs
    - initial chdir() into a child dir would fail on strange
      protection masks (following race condition fix).
    - delete subsequent root paths even if a previous one fails

2.00_10 2007-09-04 17:18:01 UTC
    - Infinite loop fix in _rmtree() for VMS (perl change #31775)
    - Documentation improvements

2.00_09 2007-08-20 18:08:31 UTC
    - Fixed up a few oddments in the race prevention code
    - Reworded/reworked the diagnostics

2.00_08 2007-08-01 00:04:35 UTC
    - Fix race condition in rmtree() as inspired by
      http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79685

2.00_07 2007-07-09 19:33:52 UTC
    - 2.00_06 upload unfortunately contained blib directories

2.00_06 2007-07-04 21:34:14 UTC
    - Incorporate code changes from blead
    - Skip counts off by one

2.00_05 2007-06-27 21:23:25 UTC
    - Use catfile() instead of catdir() in _mkpath() for VMS,
      patch from Craig Berry.
    - Don't use warnings (my code doesn't have errors anyway),
      code change suggested by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.
    - Don't pass LICENSE key to WriteMakefile in Makefile.PL
      if the installed version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker is not
      sufficiently modern.

1.99_02 2007-05-27 09:25:53 UTC
    - Don't allow a directory named '' (empty string) to be created.
    - File::Spec routines catdir() and updir() interact differently on Win32
    - $! needs to be managed more carefully on Win32

1.99_01 2007-05-17 13:09:59 UTC
    - Dual-lifed from the Perl core distribution.
    - New-style interface added.
    - Extensive tests added to improve code coverage.
