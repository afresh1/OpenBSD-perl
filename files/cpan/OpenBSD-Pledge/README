NAME
    OpenBSD::Pledge - Perl interface to OpenBSD pledge(2)

SYNOPSIS
      use OpenBSD::Pledge;
      my $file = "/usr/share/dict/words";
      pledge(qw( stdio rpath ), [$file]) || die "Unable to pledge: $!";

      open my $fh, '<', $file or die "Unable to open $file: $!\n";
      while (<$fh>) {
        print if /pledge/i;
      }
      close $fh;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a perl interface to OpenBSD's pledge(2) syscall.
    This is used to limit what your program can do.

    Once you pledge that your program will only make certain syscalls the
    kernel will kill the program if it attempts to call any other
    interfaces.

  EXPORT
    Exports "pledge" by default.

    ":all" will also export "pledgenames"

METHODS
  pledge(@flags, [\@paths])
    This is the primary interface to pledge.

    See the man page for more details.

    Returns true on success, returns false and sets $! on failure.

  pledgenames
    Returns a list of the possible flags you can pass to "pledge".

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Perl is particularly fond of "stdio" so you usually need to include at
    least that flag.
