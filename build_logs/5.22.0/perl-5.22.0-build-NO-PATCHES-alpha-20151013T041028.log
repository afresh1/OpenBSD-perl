Configuring
(I see you are using the Korn shell.  Some ksh's blow up on Configure,
mainly on older exotic systems.  If yours does, try the Bourne shell instead.)
 
Beginning of configuration questions for perl5.
 
Checking echo to see how to suppress newlines...
...using \c
The star should be here-->*
 
First let's make sure your kit is complete.  Checking...
Looks good...
 

This installation shell script will examine your system and ask you questions
to determine how the perl5 package should be installed. If you get
stuck on a question, you may use a ! shell escape to start a subshell or
execute a command.  Many of the questions will have default answers in square
brackets; typing carriage return will give you the default.

On some of the questions which ask for file or directory names you are allowed
to use the ~name construct to specify the login directory belonging to "name",
even if you don't have a shell which knows about that.  Questions where this is
allowed will be marked "(~name ok)".

[Type carriage return to continue]  

The prompter used in this script allows you to use shell variables and
backticks in your answers.  You may use $1, $2, etc...  to refer to the words
in the default answer, as if the default line was a set of arguments given to a
script shell.  This means you may also use $* to repeat the whole default line,
so you do not have to re-type everything to add something to the default.

Every time there is a substitution, you will have to confirm.  If there is an
error (e.g. an unmatched backtick), the default answer will remain unchanged
and you will be prompted again.

If you are in a hurry, you may run 'Configure -d'.  This will bypass nearly all
the questions and use the computed defaults (or the previous answers if there
was already a config.sh file). Type 'Configure -h' for a list of options.
You may also start interactively and then answer '& -d' at any prompt to turn
on the non-interactive behaviour for the remainder of the execution.

[Type carriage return to continue]  

Much effort has been expended to ensure that this shell script will run on any
Unix system.  If despite that it blows up on yours, your best bet is to edit
Configure and run it again.  If you can't run Configure for some reason,
you'll have to generate a config.sh file by hand.  Whatever problems you
have, let me (perlbug@perl.org) know how I blew it.

This installation script affects things in two ways:

1) it may do direct variable substitutions on some of the files included
   in this kit.
2) it builds a config.h file for inclusion in C programs.  You may edit
   any of these files as the need arises after running this script.

If you make a mistake on a question, there is no easy way to back up to it
currently.  The easiest thing to do is to edit config.sh and rerun all the SH
files.  Configure will offer to let you do this before it runs the SH files.

Checking compatibility between /bin/echo and builtin echo (if any)...
They are not compatible!  You are probably running ksh on a non-USG system.
I'll have to use /bin/echo instead of the builtin, since Bourne shell doesn't
have echo built in and we may have to run some Bourne shell scripts.  That
means I'll have to use '-n' to suppress newlines now.  Life is ridiculous.

You may give one or more space-separated answers, or "none" if appropriate.
If you have a handcrafted Policy.sh file or a Policy.sh file generated by a
previous run of Configure, you may specify it as well as or instead of
OS-specific hints.  If hints are provided for your OS, you should use them:
although Perl can probably be built without hints on many platforms, using
hints often improve performance and may enable features that Configure can't
set up on its own. If there are no hints that match your OS, specify "none";
DO NOT give a wrong version or a wrong OS.

Which of these apply, if any? [openbsd]  

Configure uses the operating system name and version to set some defaults.
The default value is probably right if the name rings a bell. Otherwise,
since spelling matters for me, either accept the default or answer "none"
to leave it blank.

Operating system name? [openbsd]  
 
Operating system version? [5.8]  

By default, perl5 will be installed in /usr/local/bin, manual pages
under /usr/local/man, etc..., i.e. with /usr/local as prefix for all
installation directories. Typically this is something like /usr/local.
If you wish to have binaries under /usr/bin but other parts of the
installation under /usr/local, that's ok: you will be prompted
separately for each of the installation directories, the prefix being
only used to set the defaults.

Installation prefix to use? (~name ok) [/usr/local]  
 
AFS does not seem to be running...

In some special cases, particularly when building perl5 for distribution,
it is convenient to distinguish the directory in which files should be
installed from the directory (/usr/local) in which they will
eventually reside.  For most users, these two directories are the same.

What installation prefix should I use for installing files? (~name ok)
[/usr/local]  
 
Getting the current patchlevel...
(You have perl5 version 22 subversion 0.)

Perl can be built to offer a form of threading support on some systems
To do so, Configure can be run with -Dusethreads.

Note that Perl built with threading support runs slightly slower
and uses slightly more memory than plain Perl.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'n'.
Build a threading Perl? [n]  
Your platform has some specific hints regarding threaded builds, using them...

Perl can be built so that multiple Perl interpreters can coexist
within the same Perl executable.
 
If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'n'.
Build Perl for multiplicity? [n]  
 
Use which C compiler? [cc]  
 
Hmm...  Looks kind of like a BSD system, but we'll see...
 
Congratulations.  You aren't running Eunice.
 
It's not Xenix...
 
Nor is it Venix...
 
Checking for GNU cc in disguise and/or its version number...
You are using GNU cc 4.2.1 20070719 .
 
Hmm...  Doesn't look like a MIPS system.
 
Now, how can we feed standard input to your C preprocessor...
Maybe "cc -E" will work...
Nope...maybe "cc -E -" will work...
Yup, it does.

Some systems have incompatible or broken versions of libraries.  Among
the directories listed in the question below, please remove any you
know not to be holding relevant libraries, and add any that are needed.
Say "none" for none.

Directories to use for library searches? [/usr/lib /usr/local/lib]  

On some systems, shared libraries may be available.  Answer 'none' if
you want to suppress searching of shared libraries for the remainder
of this configuration.

What is the file extension used for shared libraries? [so]  

Some dynamic loaders assume that the *basename* of shared library filenames
are globally unique.  We'll default this to undef as we assume your system
is not this weird. Set to defined if you're on one of them.

Make shared library basenames unique? [n]  

Perl can be built to use the SOCKS proxy protocol library.  To do so,
Configure must be run with -Dusesocks.  If you use SOCKS you also need
to use the PerlIO abstraction layer, this will be implicitly selected.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'n'.
Build Perl for SOCKS? [n]  

Perl can be built to take advantage of long doubles which
(if available) may give more accuracy and range for floating point numbers.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'n'.
Try to use long doubles if available? [n]

In order to compile perl5 on your machine, a number of libraries
are usually needed.  Include any other special libraries here as well.
Say "none" for none.  The default list is almost always right.
 
What libraries to use? [-lpthread -lm -lutil -lc]  

By default, perl5 compiles with the -O flag to use the optimizer.
Alternately, you might want to use the symbolic debugger, which uses
the -g flag (on traditional Unix systems).  Either flag can be
specified here.  To use neither flag, specify the word "none".

What optimizer/debugger flag should be used? [-O2]  
 
Checking if your compiler accepts -fno-strict-aliasing
Yes, it does.
 
Checking if your compiler accepts -pipe
Yes, it does.
 
Checking if your compiler accepts -fstack-protector-strong
Yes, it does.

Your C compiler may want other flags.  For this question you should include
-I/whatever and -DWHATEVER flags and any other flags used by the C compiler,
but you should NOT include libraries or ld flags like -lwhatever.  If you
want perl5 to honor its debug switch, you should include -DDEBUGGING here.
Your C compiler might also need additional flags, such as -D_POSIX_SOURCE.

To use no flags, specify the word "none".

Any additional cc flags?
[-fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -I/usr/local/include]  
 
Let me guess what the preprocessor flags are...
They appear to be: -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -I/usr/local/include

Your C linker may need flags.  For this question you should
include -L/whatever and any other flags used by the C linker, but you
should NOT include libraries like -lwhatever.

Make sure you include the appropriate -L/path flags if your C linker
does not normally search all of the directories you specified above,
namely
	/usr/lib /usr/local/lib
To use no flags, specify the word "none".

Any additional ld flags (NOT including libraries)?
[-Wl,-E  -fstack-protector-strong -L/usr/local/lib]  
 
Checking your choice of C compiler and flags for coherency...
OK, that should do.
 
Computing filename position in cpp output for #include directives...
Your cpp writes the filename in the third field of the line.
 
<stdlib.h> found.
 
Checking to see how big your integers are...
Your integers are 4 bytes long.
Your long integers are 8 bytes long.
Your short integers are 2 bytes long.
 
Checking to see if you have long long...
You have long long.
 
Checking to see how big your long longs are...
Your long longs are 8 bytes long.
(That isn't any different from an ordinary long.)
 
<inttypes.h> found.
 
Checking to see if you have int64_t...
You have int64_t.
 
Checking which 64-bit integer type we could use...
We could use 'long' for 64-bit integers.

You have natively 64-bit long integers.

You may also choose to try maximal 64-bitness.  It means using as much
64-bitness as possible on the platform.  This in turn means even more
binary incompatibilities.  On the other hand, your platform may not
have any more 64-bitness available than what you already have chosen.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'y'.
(The default has been chosen based on your configuration.)
Try to use maximal 64-bit support, if available? [y]  
 
Checking if your C library has broken 64-bit functions...
Your C library's 64-bit functions are ok.
 
Checking for GNU C Library...
You are not using the GNU C Library

I can use /usr/bin/nm to extract the symbols from your C libraries. This
is a time consuming task which may generate huge output on the disk (up
to 3 megabytes) but that should make the symbols extraction faster. The
alternative is to skip the 'nm' extraction part and to compile a small
test program instead to determine whether each symbol is present. If
you have a fast C compiler and/or if your 'nm' output cannot be parsed,
this may be the best solution.

You probably shouldn't let me use 'nm' if you are using the GNU C Library.

Shall I use /usr/bin/nm to extract C symbols from the libraries? [y]  
 
Your (shared) C library seems to be in /usr/lib/libc.so.83.0.

If the guess above is wrong (which it might be if you're using a strange
compiler, or your machine supports multiple models), you can override it here.

Where is your C library? [/usr/lib/libc.so.83.0]  
 
Extracting names from the following files for later perusal:
 
	/usr/lib/libc.so.83.0
	/usr/lib/libm.so.9.0
	/usr/lib/libpthread.so.19.0
	/usr/lib/libutil.so.12.1
 
This may take a while.....done.
 
Checking for C++...
You are not using a C++ compiler.
 
Checking to see how big your double precision numbers are...
Your double is 8 bytes long.
 
<float.h> found.
 
Checking to see if you have long double...
You have long double.
 
ldexpl() found.
 
Checking to see how big your long doubles are...
Your long doubles are 8 bytes long.
That isn't any different from an ordinary double.
I'll keep your setting anyway, but you may see some
harmless compilation warnings.
Checking the kind of long doubles you have...
Your long doubles are doubles.
 
What is your architecture name [OpenBSD.alpha-openbsd]  
Add the Perl API version to your archname? [n]  
This architecture is naturally 64-bit, not changing architecture name.
 
Pathname where the public executables will reside? (~name ok)
[/usr/local/bin]  

Would you like to build Perl so that the installation is relocatable, so that
library paths in @INC are determined relative to the path of the perl binary?
This is not advised for system Perl installs, or if you need to run setid
scripts or scripts under taint mode.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'n'.
Use relocatable @INC? [n]  

There are some auxiliary files for perl5 that need to be put into a
private library directory that is accessible by everyone.

Pathname where the private library files will reside? (~name ok)
[/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.22.0]  

Perl5 contains architecture-dependent library files.  If you are
sharing libraries in a heterogeneous environment, you might store
these files in a separate location.  Otherwise, you can just include
them with the rest of the public library files.

Where do you want to put the public architecture-dependent libraries? (~name ok)
[/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.22.0/OpenBSD.alpha-openbsd]  

Some kernels have a bug that prevents setuid #! scripts from being
secure.  Some sites have disabled setuid #! scripts because of this.

First let's decide if your kernel supports secure setuid #! scripts.
(If setuid #! scripts would be secure but have been disabled anyway,
don't say that they are secure if asked.)

If you are not sure if they are secure, I can check but I'll need a
username and password different from the one you are using right now.
If you don't have such a username or don't want me to test, simply
enter 'none'.

Other username to test security of setuid scripts with? [none]  
Well, the recommended value *is* secure.
Does your kernel have *secure* setuid scripts? [y]  
Looking for a previously installed perl5.005 or later... 
Using /usr/bin/perl.

After perl5 is installed, you may wish to install various
add-on modules and utilities.  Typically, these add-ons will
be installed under /usr/local with the rest
of this package.  However, you may wish to install such add-ons
elsewhere under a different prefix.

If you do not wish to put everything under a single prefix, that's
ok.  You will be prompted for the individual locations; this siteprefix
is only used to suggest the defaults.

The default should be fine for most people.

Installation prefix to use for add-on modules and utilities? (~name ok)
[/usr/local]  

The installation process will create a directory for
site-specific extensions and modules.  Most users find it convenient
to place all site-specific files in this directory rather than in the
main distribution directory.

Pathname for the site-specific library files? (~name ok)
[/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.22.0]  

In order to ease the process of upgrading, this version of perl
can be configured to use modules built and installed with earlier
versions of perl that were installed under /usr/local.  Specify here
the list of earlier versions that this version of perl should check.
If Configure detected no earlier versions of perl installed under
/usr/local, then the list will be empty.  Answer 'none' to tell perl
to not search earlier versions.

The default should almost always be sensible, so if you're not sure,
just accept the default.
List of earlier versions to include in @INC? [none]  
 
<malloc/malloc.h> NOT found.
 
<malloc.h> found.
 
Checking to see how big your pointers are...
Your pointers are 8 bytes long.
 
Do you wish to wrap malloc calls to protect against potential overflows? [y]  
 
Do you wish to attempt to use the malloc that comes with perl5? [n]  
 
Your system wants malloc to return 'void *', it would seem.
Your system uses void free(), it would seem.

The installation process will also create a directory for
architecture-dependent site-specific extensions and modules.

Pathname for the site-specific architecture-dependent library files? (~name ok)
[/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.22.0/OpenBSD.alpha-openbsd]  

The installation process will also create a directory for
vendor-supplied add-ons.  Vendors who supply perl with their system
may find it convenient to place all vendor-supplied files in this
directory rather than in the main distribution directory.  This will
ease upgrades between binary-compatible maintenance versions of perl.

Of course you may also use these directories in whatever way you see
fit.  For example, you might use them to access modules shared over a
company-wide network.

The default answer should be fine for most people.
This causes further questions about vendor add-ons to be skipped
and no vendor-specific directories will be configured for perl.

Do you want to configure vendor-specific add-on directories? [n]  

Lastly, you can have perl look in other directories for extensions and
modules in addition to those already specified.
These directories will be searched after
	/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.22.0/OpenBSD.alpha-openbsd
	/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.22.0
 
Enter a colon-separated set of extra paths to include in perl's @INC
search path, or enter 'none' for no extra paths.

Colon-separated list of additional directories for perl to search? [none]  
 
Checking out function prototypes...
Your C compiler appears to support function prototypes.

Perl can be built to support DTrace on platforms that support it.
DTrace is a diagnosis and performance analysis tool from Sun.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'none'.
Support DTrace if available? [n]  
 
Perl can be built with extra modules or bundles of modules which
will be fetched from the CPAN and installed alongside Perl.

Notice that you will need access to the CPAN; either via the Internet,
or a local copy, for example a CD-ROM or a local CPAN mirror.  (You will
be asked later to configure the CPAN.pm module which will in turn do
the installation of the rest of the extra modules or bundles.)

Notice also that if the modules require any external software such as
libraries and headers (the libz library and the zlib.h header for the
Compress::Zlib module, for example) you MUST have any such software
already installed, this configuration process will NOT install such
things for you.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'n'.
Install any extra modules (y or n)? [n]  
 

If you wish to install html files for programs in Perl5, indicate
the appropriate directory here.  To skip installing html files,
answer "none".
Directory for the main Perl5 html pages? (~name ok) [none]  

If you wish to install html files for modules associated with Perl5,
indicate the appropriate directory here.  To skip installing html files,
answer "none".
Directory for the Perl5 module html pages? (~name ok) [none]  
 
Many scripts expect perl to be installed as /usr/bin/perl.

If you want to, I can install the perl you are about to compile
as /usr/bin/perl (in addition to /usr/local/bin/perl).

However, please note that because you already have a /usr/bin/perl,
overwriting that with a new Perl would very probably cause problems.
Therefore I'm assuming you don't want to do that (unless you insist).

Do you want to install perl as /usr/bin/perl? [n]  
 
dlopen() found.
 
<unistd.h> found.
 
Do you wish to use dynamic loading? [y]  
The following dynamic loading files are available:
ext/DynaLoader/dl_aix.xs                ext/DynaLoader/dl_hpux.xs
ext/DynaLoader/dl_dllload.xs            ext/DynaLoader/dl_none.xs
ext/DynaLoader/dl_dlopen.xs             ext/DynaLoader/dl_symbian.xs
ext/DynaLoader/dl_dyld.xs               ext/DynaLoader/dl_vms.xs
ext/DynaLoader/dl_freemint.xs           ext/DynaLoader/dl_win32.xs
Source file to use for dynamic loading [ext/DynaLoader/dl_dlopen.xs]  

Some systems may require passing special flags to cc -c to
compile modules that will be used to create a shared library.
To use no flags, say "none".

Any special flags to pass to cc -c to compile shared library modules?
[-DPIC -fPIC ]  

Some systems use ld to create libraries that can be dynamically loaded,
while other systems (such as those using ELF) use cc.

What command should be used to create dynamic libraries? [cc]  

Some systems may require passing special flags to cc to create a
library that can be dynamically loaded.  If your ld flags include
-L/other/path options to locate libraries outside your loader's normal
search path, you may need to specify those -L options here as well.  To
use no flags, say "none".

Any special flags to pass to cc to create a dynamically loaded library?
[-shared -fPIC  -L/usr/local/lib -fstack-protector-strong]  

Some systems may require passing special flags to cc to indicate that
the resulting executable will use dynamic linking.  To use no flags,
say "none".

Any special flags to pass to cc to use dynamic linking? [none]  
ld supports scripting

The perl executable is normally obtained by linking perlmain.c with
libperl.a, any static extensions (usually just DynaLoader), and
any other libraries needed on this system (such as -lm, etc.).  Since
your system supports dynamic loading, it is probably possible to build
a shared libperl.so.  If you will have more than one executable linked
to libperl.so, this will significantly reduce the size of each
executable, but it may have a noticeable effect on performance.  The
default is probably sensible for your system.


Build a shared libperl.so (y/n) [n]  
 
System manual is in /usr/share/man/man1.

Perl5 has manual pages available in source form.
However, you don't have nroff, so they're probably useless to you.
If you don't want the manual sources installed, answer 'none'.
 
Where do the main Perl5 manual pages (source) go? (~name ok) [none]  
 
You can have filenames longer than 14 characters.

Perl5 has manual pages for many of the library modules.
However, you don't have nroff, so they're probably useless to you.
If you don't want the manual sources installed, answer 'none'.

Figuring out host name...
Maybe "hostname" will work...
Your host name appears to be "alpha.home.hewus.com". Right? [y]  
(Trimming domain name from host name--host name is now alpha)
 
What is your domain name? [.home.hewus.com]  

I need to get your e-mail address in Internet format if possible, i.e.
something like user@host.domain. Please answer accurately since I have
no easy means to double check it. The default value provided below
is most probably close to reality but may not be valid from outside
your organization...

What is your e-mail address? [afresh1@alpha.home.hewus.com]  

If you or somebody else will be maintaining perl at your site, please
fill in the correct e-mail address here so that they may be contacted
if necessary. Currently, the "perlbug" program included with perl
will send mail to this address in addition to perlbug@perl.org. You may
enter "none" for no administrator.

Perl administrator e-mail address [afresh1@alpha.home.hewus.com]  
 
Do you want to install only the version-specific parts of the perl
distribution?  Usually you do *not* want to do this.
Do you want to install only the version-specific parts of perl? [n]  

I can use the #! construct to start perl on your system. This will
make startup of perl scripts faster, but may cause problems if you
want to share those scripts and perl is not in a standard place
(/usr/local/bin/perl) on all your platforms. The alternative
is to force a shell by starting the script with a single ':' character.

What shall I put after the #! to start up perl ("none" to not use #!)?
[/usr/local/bin/perl]  
I'll use #!/usr/local/bin/perl to start perl scripts.

Some installations have a separate directory just for executable scripts so
that they can mount it across multiple architectures but keep the scripts in
one spot.  You might, for example, have a subdirectory of /usr/share for this.
Or you might just lump your scripts in with all your other executables.

Where do you keep publicly executable scripts? (~name ok) [/usr/local/bin]  
Pathname where the add-on public executables should be installed? (~name ok)
[/usr/local/bin]  
Pathname where the site-specific html pages should be installed? (~name ok)

Perl can be built to use 'fast stdio', which means using the stdio
library but also directly manipulating the stdio buffers to enable
faster I/O.  Using stdio is better for backward compatibility (especially
for Perl extensions), but on the other hand since Perl 5.8 the 'perlio'
interface has been preferred instead of stdio.

If this doesn't make any sense to you, just accept the default 'n'.
Use the "fast stdio" if available? [n]

Perl can only use a vfork() that doesn't suffer from strict
restrictions on calling functions or modifying global data in
the child.  For example, glibc-2.1 contains such a vfork()
that is unsuitable.  If your system provides a proper fork()
call, chances are that you do NOT want perl to use vfork().

Do you still want to use vfork()? [y]

In the following, larger digits indicate more significance.  A big-endian
machine like a Pyramid or a Motorola 680?0 chip will come out to 4321. A
little-endian machine like a Vax or an Intel 80?86 chip would be 1234. Other
machines may have weird orders like 3412.  A Cray will report 87654321,
an Alpha will report 12345678. If the test program works the default is
probably right.

Looking for extensions...
A number of extensions are supplied with perl5.  You may choose to
compile these extensions for dynamic loading (the default), compile
them into the perl5 executable (static loading), or not include
them at all.  Answer "none" to include no extensions.
Note that DynaLoader is always built and need not be mentioned here.

What extensions do you wish to load dynamically?

    Propagating recommended variable $ARCH...
 
Doing variable substitutions on .SH files...
Extracting config.h (with variable substitutions)
cflags.SH: Adding -std=c89.
cflags.SH: Adding -Werror=declaration-after-statement.
cflags.SH: Adding -Wextra.
cflags.SH: Adding -Wc++-compat.
cflags.SH: Adding -Wwrite-strings.
cflags.SH: cc       = cc
cflags.SH: ccflags  = -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fstack-protector-strong -I/usr/local/include -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
cflags.SH: stdflags =  -std=c89
cflags.SH: optimize = -O2
cflags.SH: warn     =  -Wall -Werror=declaration-after-statement -Wextra -Wc++-compat -Wwrite-strings
Extracting cflags (with variable substitutions)
Not re-extracting config.h
Extracting makedepend (with variable substitutions)
Extracting Makefile (with variable substitutions)
Extracting myconfig (with variable substitutions)
Extracting pod/Makefile (with variable substitutions)
Extracting Policy.sh (with variable substitutions)
Extracting runtests (with variable substitutions)

Now you need to generate make dependencies by running "make depend".
You might prefer to run it in background: "make depend > makedepend.out &"
It can take a while, so you might not want to run it right now.

Run make depend now? [y]

Updating makefile...
Now you must run 'make'.

If you compile perl5 on a different machine or from a different object
directory, copy the Policy.sh file from this object directory to the
new one before you run Configure -- this will help you with most of
the policy defaults.
